🌐 Web Development Journey: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MERN & Tailwind CSS
Welcome to my Web Development journey! 🚀

This repository is a collection of everything I’m learning and building — from basic frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to full stack projects using the MERN stack and styling with Tailwind CSS. My goal is to document my growth, deepen my understanding, and share useful examples with others who are also exploring web development.

📂 What's Inside?
You’ll find code, projects, and practice files covering:

Frontend fundamentals:

HTML & CSS layouts, responsive design, Flexbox, Grid

Vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation & small interactive features

Styling with Tailwind CSS:

UI components, custom themes, utility-first design approach

Full Stack MERN projects:

MongoDB (database)

Express.js (backend framework)

React.js (frontend library)

Mini projects & practice apps:

Landing pages, forms, to-do lists, weather apps, etc.

Well-commented code and occasional explanations to make learning easier

💡 Why This Repository?
This repository serves as:

📒 A learning log to track my progress and understanding

🧰 A resource for other beginners and developers

🛠️ A portfolio showcasing my coding style, projects, and problem-solving skills

📌 Note
All code here is part of my personal learning process.
It may not always be the most optimized or production-ready, but it reflects my effort to truly understand and experiment with web technologies.
